# Lab #4 Auxiliary MCU to Mt3620 to Azure IoT Hub

This lab covers the scenario of a serial (UART) connected auxiliary MCU sending telemetry data to Azure Sphere as connectivity module connecting 
to Azure IoT Hub.

>**Note**, the MT3620 board is a 3.3V board so either use a 3.3V MCU or a [Level Shifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_shifter) to 
>convert the voltage levels!

For this lab, an existing MCU is provided that already produces the serial data.  For your own lab, the code is as follows
(see also [MCUSerialSketch.ino](./MCUSerialSketch/MCUSerialSketch.ino) ):

```C
float temp, humidity;
String message;

void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
	pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
	// turn LED on and output randomized temperature and humidity once per second
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
	temp = random(7100, 7500);
	humidity = random(3000, 4000);
	message = "Temperature:";
	message += temp / 100;
	message += ";Humidity:";
	message += humidity / 100;
	Serial.println(message);
	delay(100);
	// turn LED off
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
	delay(900);
}
```

The output from the other MCU is as follows:

## Wiring the devices (for NodeMCU) [NodeMCU]
This step assumes you are using the smaller NodeMCU, that runs on 3.3V as well.  If using the Arduino UNO, refer to the next section.

With the Sphere and the other MCU unplugged from power, wire the device as follows:

| Purpose                     | MT3620                  | Aux MCU            |
|-----------------------------|:-----------------------:|:------------------:|
| 3.3V power for NodeMCU      | 3.3V (Header 3, pin 3)  | 3.3V (pin varies)  |
| Common Ground               | GND (Header 1, pin 2)   | Gnd (pin varies)   |
| Transmit from MCU to Sphere | RX (Header 2, pin 1)    | TX (pin varies)    |

Notice that the Transmit on the auxilary MCU is wired to the Receive on Azure Sphere.  
You can use Azure Sphere 3.3V power out and ground to power the auxiliary MCU.

For information on the pinout of the board see [GPIO pinout](https://github.com/JuergenSchwertl/AzureSphereSamples#uart-pinout).

## Wiring the devices (for Arduino UNO R3)

This section is for the Arduino Uno R3.  If using the Node MCU, refer to the previous section.

Because the Arduino Uno R3 is a 5.0 Volt board and the Azure Sphere is a 3.3 volt, we will use a Logic Level Shifter to convert voltages.
Wire the UNO to the Level Shifter to the MT3620 as shown below.  The following table explains the wiring:

| UNO          | Wire Color | Level Shifter | Level Shifter | Wire Color | MT3620 |
|--------------|:------:|:---:|:---:|:------:|---------:|
| Pin 0 (RX)   | Green  | B1  | A1  | Yellow | H2 Pin 3 |
| Pin 1 (TX)   | Yellow | B2  | A2  | Green  | H2 Pin 1 |
| GND	       | Black  | GND | GND | Black  | H3 Pin 2 |
| 5-volt power | Red    | HV  | LV  | Red    | H3 Pin 3 |

This picture shows the boards wired up:

## Modifying the code

Step 1.	In Visual Studio, open Mt3620DirectDHT\Mt3620DirectDHT.sln
Step 2.	In the Solution Explorer, under the Mt3620DirectDHT solution, right click on Reference and “Add Connected Service” as shown below:

![Add Connected Service](./images/VS_Add_Connected_Service.png)

Select "Device Connectivity with Azure IoT", then your Azure Subscription, Connection Type: "Device Provisioning Service" and your previously created Device provisioning service from the list and press [Add]. 
Make sure that the output shows updates to both `AllowedConnections` and `DeviceAuthentication` properties in the app_manifest.json file.
```
[11.02.2019 18:03:35.153] Adding Device Connectivity with Azure IoT to the project.
[11.02.2019 18:03:35.329] The following hostnames have been added to the AllowedConnections attribute of app_manifest.json: global.azure-devices-provisioning.net, JS-MS-Iot-Hub.azure-devices.net
[11.02.2019 18:03:35.341] The Azure Sphere tenant ID 'c0b88764-9273-46ab-bab2-effecf13f91c' has been added to the DeviceAuthentication attribute of app_manifest.json .
[11.02.2019 18:03:36.441] Azure Sphere Device Provisioning Service scope id:'0ne0002304B'
[11.02.2019 18:03:36.449] Successfully added Device Connectivity with Azure IoT to the project.
```


**Pls. note**
> In the 19.02 version of the Azure Sphere SDK, the Add Connected Service wizard created the required files *azure_iot_tilities.c/.h* and *parson.c/.h* automatically, 
> provisioned the DPS Scope ID and setup the *appmanifest.json*.
> 
> In the 19.05 version, the wizard only applies the required capability settings to the *appmanifest.json* but does **not** create the source files anymore. For your convenience, I've added these files in the project already,
> however, you need to manually add the DPS Scope ID to *azure_iot_utilities.c* in line #21 : 

```C
//
// String containing the scope id of the Device Provisioning Service
// used to provision the app with the IoT hub hostname and the device id.
//
static const char scopeId[] = "[Enter your DPS scope ID here]";
```

> You can find the DPS Scope ID in the [DPS settings in the Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Devices%2FProvisioningServices).
> The Add Connected Service wizard also provides the Scope ID in the *appmanifest.json* as `"CmdArgs"`-property.

Step 3. Open *azure_iot_utilities.h* on or about line **#41** and add the following code as shown below 
(you can copy these lines also from *azure_iot_utilities-snippets.txt* from the Solution Items folder)
```C
/// <summary>
///     Creates and enqueues reported properties state using a prepared json string.
///     The report is not actually sent immediately, but it is sent on the next 
///     invocation of AzureIoT_DoPeriodicTasks().
/// </summary>
void AzureIoT_TwinReportStateJson(
	char *reportedPropertiesString,
	size_t reportedPropertiesSize);
```
![azure_iot_utilities.h](./images/VS_azureiotutil_h.png)

Step 4.	Open *azure_iot_utilities.c* and at the end of the file, on or about line **#463** add the following code, as shown below:
```C
/// <summary>
///     Creates and enqueues reported properties state using a prepared json string.
///     The report is not actually sent immediately, but it is sent on the next 
///     invocation of AzureIoT_DoPeriodicTasks().
/// </summary>
void AzureIoT_TwinReportStateJson(
	char *reportedPropertiesString,
	size_t reportedPropertiesSize)
{
	if (iothubClientHandle == NULL) {
		LogMessage("ERROR: client not initialized\n");
	}
	else {
		if (reportedPropertiesString != NULL) {
			if (IoTHubDeviceClient_LL_SendReportedState(iothubClientHandle,
				(unsigned char *)reportedPropertiesString, reportedPropertiesSize,
				reportStatusCallback, 0) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK) {
				LogMessage("ERROR: failed to set reported state as '%s'.\n",
					reportedPropertiesString);
			}
			else {
				LogMessage("INFO: Reported state as '%s'.\n", reportedPropertiesString);
			}
		}
		else {
			LogMessage("ERROR: no JSON string for Device Twin reporting.\n");
		}
	}
}
```
![azure_iot_utilities.c](./images/VS_azureiotutil_c.png)

Step 5.	In Visual Studio, click “Remote GDB Debugger” to compile, deploy, run and debug the code on the device.

Step 6.	Monitoring the output window in Visual Studio, you should see the device send the temperature every second as shown below.  
Note how we send telemetry for the Temperature and Humidity while updating the Device Twin when the maximum and minimum temperature changes.

![Azure Sphere log output](./images/MCU_Log_Output.png)

Step 7.	Using Azure Device Explorer, viewing the Device Twin properties you should see the min and max temperature received.
>You can get Device Explorer from the [Azure IoT Hub C# SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/master/tools/DeviceExplorer).
>A pre-built version of the Device Explorer application for Windows can be downloaded from https://aka.ms/aziotdevexp as well as 
>the [Releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases) page. (Scroll down for __SetupDeviceExplorer.msi__). 
>The default installation directory for this application is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DeviceExplorer". 
>You might want to pin the DeviceExplorer.exe application to the taskbar for easier access.

Step 8.	Using Azure Device Explorer, monitoring the data, you should see both temperature and humidity sent as a JSON message.

![Device Explorer-Monitoring Telemetry Messages](./images/DeviceExplorer_MCU_Data.png "Device Explorer-Monitoring Telemetry Messages")

Step 9.	Unique to this lab, we enabled the Uart `ISU0` in the [*app_manifest.json*](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/app_manifest.json) as shown below:

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": 1,
  "Name": "MCUtoMT3620toAzure",
  "ComponentId": "B3A4C1C2-0AA9-41AD-A8A7-4DE822FE84D3",
  "EntryPoint": "/bin/app",
  "CmdArgs": [],
  "TargetApplicationRuntimeVersion": 2,
  "Capabilities": {
    "AllowedConnections": [ ],
    "AllowedTcpServerPorts": [],
    "AllowedUdpServerPorts": [],
    "Gpio": [ 48, 14, 11 ],
    "Uart": [ "ISU0" ],
    "WifiConfig": false,
    "NetworkConfig": false,
    "SystemTime": false
  }
}
```

## Reviewing the code (*main.c*)
Lines 19 - 20 include UART and MCU utilities that are not part of the Azure Sphere SDK.

[MCUtoMT3620toAzure/main.c Line 19ff](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/main.c#L169)
 
## Reviewing the code (*UART_utilities.c*)

[`UART_InitializeAndAddToEpoll`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/UART_utilities.c#L116) configures the settings for the UART, 
opens the UART file descriptor and registers the epoll event handler.
>Make sure you have added the "ISU0" capability in the *appmanifest.json*.
 
[`handleUartEvent`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/UART_utilities.c#L45) reads incoming data from the UART into the ring buffer 
and then searches the buffer for `LINE_DELIMITER` characters. For each received line it calls another event handler
 ([*MCU_utilities.c*`MCU_ParseDataToIotHub`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/MCU_utilities.c#L173)).
 
You can add the following line to *UART_utilities.h* to get more verbose output on the fragments that are being read in the event handler. 
```C
#define VERBOSE
```

## Reviewing the code (*MCU_utilities.c*)

[`MCU_ParseDataToIotHub`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/MCU_utilities.c#L173) parses the incoming line in the 
format "key:value;key:value" in [`parseMessage`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/MCU_utilities.c#L78) and extract the Temperature and
Humidity in [`parseKeyValue`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/MCU_utilities.c#L58) and then sends the values to IoT Hub in 
[`checkAndSendTelemetry`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/MCU_utilities.c#L97) and potentially updates the Device Twin 
in [`checkAndUpdateDeviceTwin`](./MCUtoMT3620toAzure/MCU_utilities.c#L130).


You may continue reviewing both *UART_utilities.h/UART_utilities.c* and *MCU_utilities.h/ MCU_utilities.c* as time allows.
