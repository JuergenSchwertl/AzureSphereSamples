This folder contains pointers to the 
[Digital Twins Definition Language v2 (DTDL)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) 
schema for IoT Central and Azure Digital Twins:

The forked working repository for the IoT PnP v2 models you can find on [JuergenSchwertl/iot-plugandplay-models](https://github.com/JuergenSchwertl/iot-plugandplay-models) 
under the path [dtmi/azsphere/spherettt](https://github.com/JuergenSchwertl/iot-plugandplay-models/tree/main/dtmi/azsphere/spherettt)
This schema is going to be certified into the [Azure/iot-plugandplay-models](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models). 


For further info on how to implement a DTDL v2 schema in your code please refer to 
[IoT Plug and Play conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-develop/concepts-convention) 
that has examples on how to frame your messages/properties correctly.
