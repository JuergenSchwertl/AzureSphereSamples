# GreenSphereRT sample: MT3620 real-time capability application - Bare Metal GPIO

This directory is part of the Multi-Core OTA sample. On information how build, run and deploy the sample OTA please refer 
to the documentation in the [master directory](../README.MD).
  
For information about how to build the real-time capable application please refer to 
[RedSphereRT](../RedSphereRT/README.MD)


If you followed the instructions in the [master directory](../README.MD), all applications should have been built already and you can skip the build step.

**Build the GreenSphereRT application**
 
If you chose to build the IoTConnectHL and RedSphereRT apps manually, you first need to run Visual Studio 
(or Visual Studio Code respectively) to build the GreenSphere App as well.

1. Start Visual Studio.
1. From the **File** menu, select **Open > CMake...** and navigate to the *GreenSphereRT*-folder.
1. Select the file CMakeLists.txt and then click **Open**.
1. From the **CMake** menu (if present), select **Build All**. If the menu is not present, open Solution Explorer, 
right-click the CMakeLists.txt file, and select **Build**. This step automatically performs the manual packaging steps. 
The output location of the Azure Sphere application appears in the Output window.

**Manually deploy the GreenSphereRT application**

1. Open an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt and navigate to the *./OTA/GreenSphereRT* folder. 
1. Deploy the application using 
```sh
 azsphere dev sl deploy -p "out\ARM-Debug\GreenSphereRT.imagepackage" 
```
You will see that Led2 starts blinking in green at a fast rate, likely at a different frequency than Led1 in red.
1. Once you press Button A both will start blinking at the same frequency as both have received the 'BLNK' message 
1. Stop the application using
```sh
 azsphere dev app stop -i 7E5FAB32-801C-4EDF-A1AA-9263652AA6BD
```
You will see that the high-level application gracefully recovers and starts sending *PING* messages to the remaining RedSphereRT app.
1. Remove the application manually using
```sh
azsphere dev sl delete -i 7E5FAB32-801C-4EDF-A1AA-9263652AA6BD
```


**Note:** The *app_manifest.json* differs between the real-time capable applications obviously 
on the *"Name"*, *"ComponentId"* properties and most notably in the used "Gpio".

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": 1,
  "Name": "GreenSphereRT",
  "ComponentId": "7E5FAB32-801C-4EDF-A1AA-9263652AA6BD",
  "EntryPoint": "/bin/app",
  "CmdArgs": [ "GreenSphere" ],
  "Capabilities": {
    "AllowedApplicationConnections": [ "33e04e8f-a020-4af8-80d0-8064343e0616" ],
    "Gpio": [ 16 ]
  },
  "ApplicationType": "RealTimeCapable"
}
```
