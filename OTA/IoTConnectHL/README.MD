# IoTConnectHL: High-level connectivety application (POSIX)

 
**Build and deploy the high-level connectivety application (IoTConnectHL)**

>**Note:** If you had looked at this example earlier, you may have seen that it went from a Vidual Studio solution now to use the CMake toolchain, and there are slight 
>differences in the toolchain to build a realtime capable app vs a high-level app. 
>The CMakeSettings.json files for real-time applications refer to the AzureSphere**RTCore**Toolchain.cmake with the build script for realtime capable applications.
>For the IoTConnectHL application the CMakeSettings.json refers to the AzureSphereToolchain.cmake build script.
1. In Visual Studio, in the Team Explorer Window open the CmakeLists.txt file in the IoTConnectHL directory using **File->Open->Cmake...**.
2. To prepare your *app_manifest.json* with your Azure IoT Hub settings, a CMake project does not offer the "Connect to Service..." Wizard.
We therefore need to manually copy the settings from the Azure Portal. 
```json
{
  ...
  "CmdArgs": [ "**your DPS Scope ID**" ],
  "Capabilities": {
    "AllowedConnections": [ "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net", "**your Azure IoT Hub**.azure-devices.net"],
    "DeviceAuthentication": "**your Azure Sphere Tenant id**"
  }  
}
```
3. Open the [Device Provisioning Services page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Devices%2FProvisioningServices)
select your Device Provisioning service and copy the *"ID Scope"** (if you hover over the ID Scope value, it shows a copy-icon next to it to copy the name to the clipboard). 
Paste the ID Scope value into the "CmdArgs" list as first parameter replacing the *\*\*your DPS Scope ID\*\** content of the string.
4. Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Devices%2FIotHubs" target="_blank">IoT Hubs page</a>, 
select your IoT Hub for this lab and copy the *"Hostname"* from the Overview page (if you hover over the IoT Hub Hostname value, it shows a copy-icon next to it to copy the name to the clipboard).
Paste the IoT Hub Hostname into the *"AllowedConnections"* list replacing the *\*\*your Azure IoT Hub\*\*.azure-devices.net* string content.
5. Open a Azure Sphere Command window and run the following command to show your Azure Sphere Tenant ID:
```sh
azsphere tenant show-selected
```
Copy the GUID value and paste it into the *"DeviceAuthentication"* value replacing the *\*\**your Azure Sphere Tenant id\*\** string content.

Looking at *app_manifest.json* you will also have noticed the *AllowedApplicationConnections* list:
```json
    "AllowedApplicationConnections": [ "F4E25978-6152-447B-A2A1-64577582F327", 
        "7E5FAB32-801C-4EDF-A1AA-9263652AA6BD", 
        "07562362-3FEC-46C8-B0AF-DB9507F32748" ],
``` 
This list contains the ComponentIDs of potential real-time partner applications that IoTConnectHL is allowed to connect to.
In our sample, these are the ComponentIDs for the real-time capable RedSphereRT-, GreenSphereRT- and BlueSphereRT-applications.

6. Now open the *launch.vs.json* file. It contains a *"partnerComponents"* list with the same entries. The Component IDs listed instruct the Visual Studio Debugger to 
not delete these applications when deploying the high-level app IoT Connect HL. 
```json
    "partnerComponents": [ "F4E25978-6152-447B-A2A1-64577582F327", 
        "7E5FAB32-801C-4EDF-A1AA-9263652AA6BD", 
        "07562362-3FEC-46C8-B0AF-DB9507F32748" ]
```
7. In the Visual Studio debug toolbar click *"Select Startup Item..."* and select *"IoTConnectHL (HLCore)"*. Press F5 to start the application with debugging.

[Go back to "Multi-Core app and OTA deployment lab"](../README.MD)
